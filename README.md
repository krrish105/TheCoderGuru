<h3>Biography</h3>

Lets rewind to where it all began... 2019. I never knew was programming was until I watched a youtube tutorial where a teenager was explaining intricate programming concepts. This intrigued me so much that i decided to experiment on my own and thus I did a Javascript course which taught me the fundamentals of Javascript. From that point onwards, programming was continuous in my life and while my knowledge of programming is quite small, I thoroughly enjoy programming and having fun learning new programming concepts everyday. Everyone can learn how to program and i truly believe that where their is a will their is a way so what better way to learn programming than by starting together.
